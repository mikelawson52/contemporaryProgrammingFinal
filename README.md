# contemporaryProgrammingFinal
Final project for contemporary programming class.  Creates a sat nav based on video provided by professor with a touchscreen feel and only implements certain features as shown in video.
Would like to replace some of the repetative code in a couple of forms with a seperate utility class with the needed functions to call at a later date.
